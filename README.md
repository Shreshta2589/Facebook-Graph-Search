# Facebook-Graph-Search

Objectives
• Become familiar with the AJAX and JSON technologies
• Use a combination of HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, jQuery, AngularJS and PHP
• Get hands-on experience in Google Cloud App Engine or Amazon Web Services
• Get hands-on experience on how to use Bootstrap to enhance the user experience
• Provide an interface to perform Facebook search using Facebook Graph APIs

Created a webpage that allows users to query about users, pages, groups, events and places.

Created a PHP script to return a JSON formatted data stream to the front-end. The client parses the JSON data and renders it in a nicer-looking, responsive UI (i.e., using Bootstrap).

Once the user opens this page, all of the queried data is loaded using the AJAX component in JQuery or Angular JS. The AJAX code calls the PHP script. The webpage will then use JavaScript to extract data from the JSON response and display the results on the same webpage.
